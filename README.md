-- TODO:

TITAN!!!! LOCATION/MECHANICS

Workshop Preview Image! Moderate Priority.

General Polish/Gameplay Enhancements. (S to Stabalize, Moon Complete GUI, Better Ingredients, Better Pizza, Papa Johns.)


-- Done!

"Softlock" prevention. Made the alert image a button that returns you. Shows up on low fuel as well as falling.

Height to Money script/return to start (`gui.lua`) Was thinking about removing the return script on moons, or freezing/sleeping the player rocket and showing a gui. Low priority.

Planet Sprites/Pixel Scenes (`_pixel_scenes.xml`) ToDo Titan/etc.

GUI/Upgrades/Random Events (`gui.lua`) Talked about scrapping this. A lot of effort, and no ideas D:
